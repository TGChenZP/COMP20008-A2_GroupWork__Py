1. The Moonee Valley LGA includes the airport to which a significant number of Code 2 inter hospital transers (IHTs) arrive. IHTs often have extended response times due to the emergency road ambulance waiting at the airport for the patient to arrive by aircraft. Removing IHTs from the Moonee Valley Code 1 response time results in performance similar to surrounding LGAs.,,,,
